## Warnning
Web app fail to load sometimes, you can try to reload or use different browser(Goolge chrome or Safairi)! I have switched to firebase web hosting to improve visibility.

You can check out [live preview](https://caloriestracker-ab17f.firebaseapp.com/).

## Quick Start

1.  Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Yujingchen/daily-nutrition-tracker.git`
2.  Go to your project folder from your terminal
3.  Run: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4.  After install, run: `npm run start` or `yarn start`
5.  It will open your browser(http://localhost:3000)

## Note

DNT is built on top of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which means all features that create-react-app supports are available.
Live demo is deployed to Firebase Hosting
