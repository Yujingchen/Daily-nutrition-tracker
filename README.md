![Daily Nutrition Tracker](public/img/screenshots/Screenshot.png?raw=true 'Daily Nutrition Tracker')

## Warnning
Deployment on firebase is not very stable, you can try to reload or use different browser! I am finding a new cloud to deploy this project.:)

## Preview

You can check out [live preview](https://caloriestracker-ab17f.firebaseapp.com/).

## Quick Start

1.  Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/Yujingchen/daily-nutrition-tracker.git`
2.  Go to your project folder from your terminal
3.  Run: `npm install` or `yarn install`
4.  After install, run: `npm run start` or `yarn start`
5.  It will open your browser(http://localhost:3000)

## Note

DNT is built on top of [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), which means all features that create-react-app supports are available.
Live demo is deployed to Heroku(https://heroku.com/)
